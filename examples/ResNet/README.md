# ResNet Example

This example showcases the ResNet-based image classification by WebNN API.

This example leverages the network topology of [ResNet101 V2](https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/models/tflite_11_05_08/resnet_v2_101.tgz) from TFLite models with "nhwc" layout and [ResNet50 V2](https://github.com/onnx/models/blob/master/vision/classification/resnet/model/resnet50-v2-7.tar.gz) from ONNX models with "nchw" layout. It loads an image as the input by [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb) library, and loads resnet101v2_nhwc weights/biases from .npy [files](https://github.com/webmachinelearning/test-data/tree/main/models/resnet101v2_nhwc/weights) or resnet50v2_nchw weights/biases from .npy [files](https://github.com/webmachinelearning/test-data/tree/main/models/resnet50v2_nchw/weights) by [cnpy](https://github.com/rogersce/cnpy) library.

## Usage

```sh
> out/Release/ResNet -h

Example Options:
    -h                        Print this message.
    -i "<path>"               Required. Path to an image.
    -m "<path>"               Required. Path to the .npy files with trained weights/biases.
    -l "<layout>"             Optional. Specify the layout: "nchw" or "nhwc". The default value is "nchw".
    -n "<integer>"            Optional. Number of iterations. The default value is 1, and should not be less than 1.
    -d "<device preference>"  Optional. Specify a preferred kind of device: "default" or "gpu" or "cpu" to infer on. The default value is "default".
    -p "<power preference>"   Optional. Specify a preference as related to power consumption: "default" or "high-performance" or "low-power". The default value is "default".
```
